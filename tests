TEST 1
ROUNDING ERROR
Was using (int) to cast to int which is not appropriate for the ounces value as it needs to be rounded.
Changed to Math.round() and works fine now.

TEST 2
FORMATTING ERROR
Put pounds, stones and ounces instead of stones, pounds and ounces.

TEST 3
FORMATTING ERROR
Didn't do plurality correctly for "1 kilograms in stones, pounds and ounces"

TEST 4
DIDN'T CHECK INVALID INPUT
Need to change program such that invalid input is printed if an invalid input is entered.
