FIRST TESTED CONVERT FUNCTION
- Worked except for small errors due to inaccuracy in conversion constants.

TESTED CHANGE IMPERIAL
- Changed method such that it printed the total amounts of each imperial value
- Checked that the variables had been changed accordingly.
- i.e 1 stone input -> 1 stone, 14 pounds, 224 ounces

TESTED CHANGE METRIC
- Ditto
- Added print statement

- I realised storing the total number of imperial units is unecessary as you can calculate it just as easily from the number of kilograms

TESTED RETURN CERTAIN UNITS
- try 3 values with all combinations of units.
